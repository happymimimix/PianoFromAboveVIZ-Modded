## What has been tweaked: 
1. Added new items in stats display at the right top corner. 
2. NEW: Phigros style scoreing system! 
3. Very detailed debug information showing when the option is checked. 
4. UI and Accelerators tweak, more user friendly. 
5. Make FFmpeg mode fully automatic, no need for complex command typing in the command line! 

#### Hope you like my work! :)

## FAQ:
